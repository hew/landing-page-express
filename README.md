# Landing Page - Express 

This is an Express app that is meant to serve as the back end for a landing page (with a form).


## How it Works

You can basically just throw in a static website into the /public folder, and so long as you have a form element on the page somewhere this repo is designed to be pretty plug-and-play. 


## You Will Need To Configure ...

1. The form elements that you want to validate.
2. The .env variables (like the Mailgun auth, for instance)
