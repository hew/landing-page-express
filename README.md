# Express Basic Landing Page
This repo was inspired by denmart's [nodemailer-express](https://github.com/dennmart/nodemailer-express), but is customized somewhat to be used as the back end for a landing page with a form. 


## How it Works
You can basically just throw in a static landing page directory's contents into the /public folder, and so long as you have a form element on the page somewhere this repo is designed to be pretty plug-and-play. All you need to configure are the .env variables and the fields you want the form to validate.
