# Landing Page - Express 

This Express app serves as the back end for a landing page with a form.

## How it Works
You can basically just throw in a static website into the /public folder, and so long as you have a form element on the page somewhere this repo is designed to be pretty plug-and-play. All you need to configure are the .env variables and the fields you want the form to validate. 

This app is a fork of Denmart's [nodemailer-express](https://github.com/dennmart/nodemailer-express).
